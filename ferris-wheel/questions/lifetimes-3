In Refwrapper, an explicit lifetime 'a needed to be added, as well as
specificying that the reference to T has the same lifetime as T.

In RefWrapperWrapper, the trick is to say that the lifetime of the reference to
RefWrapper has at least a shorter lifetime than T. This also implies that
RefWrapper lives at least as long as RefWrapperWrapper, so that the reference in
RefWrapperWrapper will never be invalid.
