UniqueVolatile exists because it allows a pointer to be treated in essentially
the same way as an owned value. This allows the object to be send + sync.

This also provides strong aliasing guarantees. This means that the underlying T
that UniqueVolatile points to will only be modified through a unique alias to
the object.
