The type system enforces the constraints that a read cannot be written and vice
versa.

While inner() will return the inner poiner for ReadVolatile and WriteVolatile,
using core::ptr::write_volatile to write a ReadVolatile would not be possible
because the pointer is const. The same goes for reading a WriteVolatile pointer.
It is returned as a mut pointer, which cannot be passed to
core::ptr::read_volatile because it expects a const pointer.
