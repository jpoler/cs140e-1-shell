We implemented fmt::Write on both MiniUart and Console. This eventually translates to bytes being transmitted on the uart tx wire.

Traits have methods that are required and methods that are provided. fmt::Write
requires write_str, and you get write_char and write_fmt. These two provided
methods are called default implementations.
