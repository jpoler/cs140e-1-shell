The shell module directly imports the CONSOLE and uses it, along with stack vec.

StackVec provides a convenient way to manage the line-discipline that the shell
implements. It would need to provide much more flexibility if the shell would
allow the user to move the cursor within a line.

The CONSOLE uses the MiniUart, type, which in turn uses the timer and gpio
modules.
