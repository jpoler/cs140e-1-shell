Testing is harder because we basically need to write a 'ttyread' program that
will implement the other side of the xmodem protocol. This is slightly annoying,
but I have actually added the code to do so, and added a new script
test_xmodem.sh that tests the xmodem protocol. The tests pass. The one gotcha
was that the socat command was set up to create the ttys as unidirection (input
-> output), so I was looking at timeouts of the initial NAK sent from receiver
-> sender. After making the link bidirectional everything worked.
